      \    <Text>(1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Before you buy&amp;nbsp;a computer
      you need to decide what your needs are. The first decision is whether you want
      to buy a &lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Desktop Computer&lt;/SPAN&gt;
      or a &lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Notebook Computer&lt;/SPAN&gt;.
      If you&apos;ve already decided on getting a notebook computer, then you need
      to decide on the type of notebook computer. There are 3 main types of notebooks:
      &lt;BR&gt;A) &lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;All-Purpose Notebooks&lt;/SPAN&gt;
      (these are the middle of the road type, not too big or too small, not really
      heavy or really light &lt;BR&gt;B) &lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Desktop
      Replacement Notebooks&lt;/SPAN&gt; (these are bigger and heavier than the All-Purpose
      type notebooks, Desktop replacement notebooks have the biggest screens and keyboards
      but are somewhat heavy, not something you&apos;d want to be carrying around
      every day). &lt;BR&gt;C) &lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Ultraportable
      Notebooks&lt;/SPAN&gt;: These are the lightest and most portable type of notebooks.
      They are designed for people that carry the notebook with them almost every
      day. The disadvantages are the screen can be hard to read and the keyboard can
      be cramped. Also, the price for these can be a bit higher for the similar features.
      This is because the portability of these light notebooks is highly prized by
      many. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(2) I used to always buy a desktop computer because
      for a given amount of money you could buy a faster computer or one that stored
      more information by buying a desktop instead of a notebook. Portability was
      not a factor for me until I moved overseas. It was impractical to bring a desktop
      computer from the US, so I decided to buy a notebook computer. Since I would
      not be moving the notebook often, I chose to get a desktop replacement notebook.

      \    <CategoryID>177</CategoryID>\n     <Title>Simple Laptop Buying: Numbers
      Aren&apos;t Everything</Title>\n     <Text>I started out looking for a laptop
      for school: I gave myself a budget and said to myself, &quot;Buy the best laptop
      for the money.&quot; That shouldn&apos;t be hard, I figured. Just compare the
      numbers in speed and memory. Unfortunately, numbers aren&apos;t everything,
      and some numbers are more important than you would think. Here are the basics
      for non-computer-geeks about what I learned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;April 11, 2007:
      Please note that this guide was written in early 2006 and is directed mostly
      towards Windows XP or earlier laptops. However, this information will give you
      a very solid start even if you are looking for the latest and greatest. I will
      update this guide in a year or two when I upgrade to a Vista laptop... what
      is top-of-the-line today will be very affordable (and still current) tomorrow!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*
      &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Processor Speed&lt;/span&gt;:
      This is usually given in GHz (1GHz is 1000 MHz). This is a good indication of
      how fast a computer is with a given processor. Unfortunately, this is useless
      for comparing the speed for computers with different processors. For a certain
      computer speed, the processor with the least GHz usually takes less battery
      power and produces less heat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:
      bold;&quot;&gt;Processor&lt;/span&gt;: This is a good indication of how new
      and fast a computer is, and gives the speed in GHz between different models
      of a processor. Up-to-date processors include AMD Athlon, Pentium 4, Pentium
      Celeron, and Pentium M. Of the four, Pentium M is fastest for a given GHz rating,
      and as of 2006 is a very safe bet. In terms of comparing AMD Athlons and Intel
      Pentiums, I doubt there is an exact formula - each processor has to be compared
      separately. I just decided to go with the Pentium M, as it is more popular and
      gives me more options (but see below in the &quot;advanced stuff&quot;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-

      \    <Text>&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Best Laptops of 2006&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;Of
      course, everyone is entitled to bias when it comes to picking their laptop.
      I have bought and sold laptops and work as an IT professional. Here are my take
      on buying a laptop in 2006.&amp;nbsp; Believe it or not, there are currently
      about a dozen primary laptop groups that are suitable to various people. I&apos;ve
      seen many people frustrate over their laptop performance, it is usually because
      they bought the wrong one to begin with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First thing on most
      IT professionals&apos; minds in 2006 is Windows Vista. The much anticipated
      new version of Windows from Microsoft that is rumored to revolutionize Windows
      computing (it took them about 6+ years to produce it versus the 2 to 3 years
      between the previous Windows). We are all skeptics about Vista&apos;s performance
      on current hardware, if I can put it in layman&apos;s terms: don&apos;t wait.
      Just buy a solid machine today while the sales are going on. Here&apos;s why
      you shouldn&apos;t wait: the new releases of Windows are always buggy and not
      refined, it took Windows XP a few years to mature. Technology gets cheaper by
      the day, if you keep waiting, you don&apos;t have anything to use, just buy
      something and don&apos;t envy new technology. Vista is far away from being the
      best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second thing is eBay, with a big decisions like dropping
      2 grand on a laptop, spend a little extra to make sure you&apos;re buying from
      a reputable seller with some sort of buyer protection. I&apos;ve been ripped
      off on eBay many a times. Don&apos;t let it happen! No one will hear your cries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now
      let&apos;s get down to business and talk about brand names:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There
      are many brands to begin with, most of them offer similar specs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most
      popular laptop brands are (in no particular order): Dell, Apple, Lenovo (IBM
      Thinkpad), HP, Fujitsu, Sony, Gateway, Alienware, Acer, and ...</Text>\n     <CreationTime>2006-07-20T20:33:38.000Z</CreationTime>\n
