        \    <CategoryID>177</CategoryID>\n     <Title>How to buy a notebook computer.</Title>\n
        \    <Text>(1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Before you buy&amp;nbsp;a computer
        you need to decide what your needs are. The first decision is whether you
        want to buy a &lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Desktop Computer&lt;/SPAN&gt;
        or a &lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Notebook Computer&lt;/SPAN&gt;.
        If you&apos;ve already decided on getting a notebook computer, then you need
        to decide on the type of notebook computer. There are 3 main types of notebooks:
        &lt;BR&gt;A) &lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;All-Purpose Notebooks&lt;/SPAN&gt;
        (these are the middle of the road type, not too big or too small, not really
        heavy or really light &lt;BR&gt;B) &lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Desktop
        Replacement Notebooks&lt;/SPAN&gt; (these are bigger and heavier than the
        All-Purpose type notebooks, Desktop replacement notebooks have the biggest
        screens and keyboards but are somewhat heavy, not something you&apos;d want
        to be carrying around every day). &lt;BR&gt;C) &lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:
        bold&quot;&gt;Ultraportable Notebooks&lt;/SPAN&gt;: These are the lightest
        and most portable type of notebooks. They are designed for people that carry
        the notebook with them almost every day. The disadvantages are the screen
        can be hard to read and the keyboard can be cramped. Also, the price for these
        can be a bit higher for the similar features. This is because the portability
        of these light notebooks is highly prized by many. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(2)
        I used to always buy a desktop computer because for a given amount of money
        you could buy a faster computer or one that stored more information by buying
        a desktop instead of a notebook. Portability was not a factor for me until
        I moved overseas. It was impractical to bring a desktop computer from the
        US, so I decided to buy a notebook computer. Since I would not be moving the
        notebook often, I chose to get a desktop replacement notebook. The ability
        to pick up the whole computer and put i...</Text>\n     <CreationTime>2005-11-20T09:31:23.000Z</CreationTime>\n

        \    <CategoryID>177</CategoryID>\n     <Title>Simple Laptop Buying: Numbers
        Aren&apos;t Everything</Title>\n     <Text>I started out looking for a laptop
        for school: I gave myself a budget and said to myself, &quot;Buy the best
        laptop for the money.&quot; That shouldn&apos;t be hard, I figured. Just compare
        the numbers in speed and memory. Unfortunately, numbers aren&apos;t everything,
        and some numbers are more important than you would think. Here are the basics
        for non-computer-geeks about what I learned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;April 11,
        2007: Please note that this guide was written in early 2006 and is directed
        mostly towards Windows XP or earlier laptops. However, this information will
        give you a very solid start even if you are looking for the latest and greatest.
        I will update this guide in a year or two when I upgrade to a Vista laptop...
        what is top-of-the-line today will be very affordable (and still current)
        tomorrow!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Processor
        Speed&lt;/span&gt;: This is usually given in GHz (1GHz is 1000 MHz). This
        is a good indication of how fast a computer is with a given processor. Unfortunately,
        this is useless for comparing the speed for computers with different processors.
        For a certain computer speed, the processor with the least GHz usually takes
        less battery power and produces less heat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:
        bold;&quot;&gt;Processor&lt;/span&gt;: This is a good indication of how new
        and fast a computer is, and gives the speed in GHz between different models
        of a processor. Up-to-date processors include AMD Athlon, Pentium 4, Pentium
        Celeron, and Pentium M. Of the four, Pentium M is fastest for a given GHz
        rating, and as of 2006 is a very safe bet. In terms of comparing AMD Athlons
        and Intel Pentiums, I doubt there is an exact formula - each processor has
        to be compared separately. I just decided to go with the Pentium M, as it
        is more popular and gives me more options (but see below in the &quot;advanced
        stuff&quot;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Centrino: This is a common label emphasize...</Text>\n

        Guide</Title>\n     <Text>&lt;h2 style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;Best
        Laptops of 2006&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;Of course, everyone is entitled to bias
        when it comes to picking their laptop. I have bought and sold laptops and
        work as an IT professional. Here are my take on buying a laptop in 2006.&amp;nbsp;
        Believe it or not, there are currently about a dozen primary laptop groups
        that are suitable to various people. I&apos;ve seen many people frustrate
        over their laptop performance, it is usually because they bought the wrong
        one to begin with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First thing on most IT professionals&apos;
        minds in 2006 is Windows Vista. The much anticipated new version of Windows
        from Microsoft that is rumored to revolutionize Windows computing (it took
        them about 6+ years to produce it versus the 2 to 3 years between the previous
        Windows). We are all skeptics about Vista&apos;s performance on current hardware,
        if I can put it in layman&apos;s terms: don&apos;t wait. Just buy a solid
        machine today while the sales are going on. Here&apos;s why you shouldn&apos;t
        wait: the new releases of Windows are always buggy and not refined, it took
        Windows XP a few years to mature. Technology gets cheaper by the day, if you
        keep waiting, you don&apos;t have anything to use, just buy something and
        don&apos;t envy new technology. Vista is far away from being the best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second
        thing is eBay, with a big decisions like dropping 2 grand on a laptop, spend
        a little extra to make sure you&apos;re buying from a reputable seller with
        some sort of buyer protection. I&apos;ve been ripped off on eBay many a times.
        Don&apos;t let it happen! No one will hear your cries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now
        let&apos;s get down to business and talk about brand names:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There
        are many brands to begin with, most of them offer similar specs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most
        popular laptop brands are (in no particular order): Dell, Apple, Lenovo (IBM
        Thinkpad), HP, Fujitsu, Sony, Gateway, Alienware, Acer, and ...</Text>\n     <CreationTime>2006-07-20T20:33:38.000Z</CreationTime>\n
