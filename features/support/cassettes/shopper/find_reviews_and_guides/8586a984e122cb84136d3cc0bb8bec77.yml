        today&amp;rsquo;s world, everyone is expected to have a method of getting
        online. It seems the first contact information required these days is an email
        address instead of a mailing address. For that reason, many buyers look for
        a laptop to provide them with quick and portable online access. However, a
        &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.com/bhp/gtx-680&quot;&gt;laptop&lt;/a&gt;
        can be quite pricey, especially if you want the latest technology. However,
        a more affordable option is to buy a used laptop. There is a huge number of
        &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.com/bhp/dell-laptop&quot;&gt;used laptop&lt;/a&gt;
        available, which makes finding a satisfactory model easy. However, with so
        many choices, a buyer can become overwhelmed.&lt;br /&gt;\nFor more info on

        decision to purchase a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.com/bhp/sony-vaio-laptop&quot;&gt;used
        laptop&lt;/a&gt;, it is important to know some of the terminology included
        in descriptions. Without an understanding of this terminology, the buyer may
        not know just what it is that they are purchasing. Below are some terms that
        are often found in the descriptions for a used laptop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Refurbished&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There

        title=&quot;How to Buy a Used MacBook Pro&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It
        is no secret that new technology is expensive and ever-changing. Every day
        it seems there is a new cell phone or new computer hitting the market. However,
        the latest gadgets are so expensive it can leave the buyer with reeling head
        and empty pocketbook. A more economical option is to look for an item that
        was previously owned. For example, a used MacBook Pro could be just the right
        choice for a buyer who wants a great product at an affordable price. The MacBook
        Pro has been around a very long time, so older models can be purchased for
        next to nothing, while buying a used late model &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p5197.m570.l1313&amp;amp;_nkw=MacBook+Pro&amp;amp;_sacat=0&quot;&gt;MacBook
        Pro&lt;/a&gt; offers buyers buyer access to the latest technology for a lower
        price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following sections help buyers select and
        purchase a used MacBook Pro.&lt;br /&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Refurbished
        or Used?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The buyer must first determine whether to
        buy a used or refurbished model. There is a big difference between a &lt;a
        href=&quot;http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=15-inch+macbook+pro&amp;amp;_osacat=0&amp;amp;_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313&amp;amp;_nkw=used+MacBook+Pro&amp;amp;_sacat=0&quot;&gt;used

        by a private owner or business. &amp;quot;Refurbished,&amp;quot; on the other

        title=&quot;How to Buy a Laptop on a Tight Budget&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Shopping
        for a laptop can be an overwhelming experience and even more so when shopping
        on a tight budget. Cutting the budget too much could mean missing out on features
        and components that will be needed, but at the same time buying a laptop that
        has too many features can cause the shopper to spend more than needed. Shoppers
        can buy laptops on a low budget without sacrificing quality and features by
        first determining how the laptop will be used. They will need to be able to
        identify the components and features essential to their needs. Once they&amp;rsquo;ve
        determined their computer needs, shoppers can explore the various options
        for buying a computer at the lowest possible price. Whether looking for a
        new, used, or refurbished computer, shoppers can find a laptop that meets
        their needs on eBay.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nCheck out this video for more

        How the Laptop Will Be Used&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No matter how big or small
        the budget is, buyers need to first determine how they will be using their
        laptops and what they will be using their laptops for. Having a tight budget
        does not mean that shoppers have to settle for a laptop that is too heavy
        to carry, too small to use, or lacks key features that they need or want.
        While finding a laptop that has the best of everything will be difficult to
        do on a tight budget, it is still possible to find deals on laptops that have

        title=&quot;When It Comes to Laptop Size, Is Bigger Always Better?&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Choosing
        a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.com/sch/Laptops-Netbooks-/175672/i.html&quot;&gt;laptop
        computer&lt;/a&gt; can be a tougher decision than deciding on a desktop unit.
        While it is always possible to change components out on a desktop computer,
        on a laptop, what one buys is pretty much what one is stuck with. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.com/sch/Hard-Drives-HDD-SSD-NAS-/158830/i.html?_dmpt=US_Internal_Hard_Disk_Drives&amp;amp;Form%2520Factor=2%252E5%2522&amp;amp;rt=nc&quot;&gt;Hard
        drives&lt;/a&gt; can be replaced, and more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.com/sch/Memory-RAM-/170083/i.html&quot;&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;
        can be added, but other than peripherals, most laptop components are not customizable.
        Most significantly, a laptop&amp;rsquo;s monitor size, microprocessor, and
        keyboard cannot be changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While keyboard functionality
        is relatively consistent, the &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; of one laptop keyboard
        to the next can vary quite a bit. Screen size affects the overall size and
        weight of the laptop: the larger the screen, the larger the computer needs
        to be to hold it. This makes a laptop with a 17-inch screen considerably larger
        and heavier than one with a 12-inch screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For many
        people, weight is a major factor when buying a laptop. Having to lug around
        a monster with a 17-inch screen can make one feel like they are carrying their
        desktop computer everywhere they go. Large laptops are also less comfortable
        to work with in tight places, such as airplane tray tables.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus,
        other than the microprocessor itself, screen size is often the biggest determining
        factor in choosing a laptop. While some people focus on m...</Text>\n     <CreationTime>2013-08-21T02:10:53.000Z</CreationTime>\n

        title=&quot;What to Look for in a Laptop Bundle&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As
        we begin to move towards a future that is rich in technological advancements,
        having the right technology can make all the difference. In particular, the
        right computer can be a lifesaver when it comes to making life easier. A laptop
        seems to be the tool of choice, as people of all ages and backgrounds are
        clamoring for these devices. Laptops do so much, yet weigh so little. They
        are fast, sleek, and perform all of the same functions of a desktop computer
        if not more. Best of all, laptops take up hardly any space anymore. There
        is a seemingly endless supply of laptops on the market, as every year laptop
        manufacturers release their latest and greatest models with all of the accessories
        needed to get the user up and running in no time at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This
        guide will provide a deeper look into the world of laptops to help even the
        newest of users make a sound decision that will ultimately lead to the purchase
        of a new quality laptop. With so many options available on the market today,
        it is great to have the benefit of a company like eBay to provide potential
        customers with the very best selection in laptop bundles. Trying to find the
        laptop that best suits the customer can be a difficult task, especially if
        shoppers are limited to the selection of one single store. With &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.com/&quot;&gt;eBay,&lt;/a&gt;
        customers can rest assured that they will be able to browse and select from
        almost all laptop brands available.&lt;br /&gt;\nNeed more info on buying
